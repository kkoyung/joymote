# Joymote

Use Joy-Con or Pro Controller as remote control of Linux machine.

## Development environment

1. Install [joycond](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond). Start and enable it by:

    ```bash
    sudo systemctl start joycond
    sudo systemctl enable joycond
    ```

    Follow the instruction [here](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond?tab=readme-ov-file#usage) to pair the controller(s).

2. Check whether the `uinput` module is loaded, by running:

    ```bash
    lsmod | grep uinput
    ```

    If it is loaded, you will see a line like:

    ```plaintext
    uinput                 20480  0
    ```

    You can manually load the module by running:

    ```bash
    sudo modprobe uinput
    ```

    Or permanently load the module by running:

    ```bash
    sudo bash -c "cat uinput > /etc/modules-load.d/uinput.conf"
    ```

3. Set up the environment.

    ```bash
    git clone
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the code.

    ```bash
    python joymote
    ```
    ```
